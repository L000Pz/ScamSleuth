# Scam Sleuth

## Overview

**Scam Sleuth** is a platform that allows users to report scam projects, analyze websites using AI, and for admins to review, manage, and inform the public about various scams. The website provides a secure environment for users to submit reports, check suspicious URLs, and stay informed through blog posts.

## How It Works

### 1. **User Registration & Authentication**
- **Sign Up**: New users can sign up with their email, name, and password. Their password is securely hashed, and they must verify their email before their account becomes active.
- **Login**: Returning users can log in using their email and password. Once authenticated, they can access features like scam reporting, URL analysis, and commenting.

### 2. **Submitting Scam Reports**
- **Report Form**: Once logged in, users can submit reports on scam projects. They can provide details like the project name, a description, and any evidence (e.g., links, screenshots).
- **Submission Review**: All submitted reports are sent to the admin panel for review. The reports are private and only visible to admins until further action is taken.

### 3. **Ask AI: Website Trustworthiness Checker**
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Users can input a website URL to analyze how secure and trustworthy it is.
- **Scoring System**: The AI model evaluates the submitted URL and returns a **trust score**, which indicates how likely the website is to be legitimate or a scam.
- **Community Feedback**: After checking a URL, users can **leave comments** on the result page, enabling discussion and sharing additional context.

### 4. **Admin Dashboard**
- **Review Reports**: Admins can access a comprehensive list of all user-submitted scam reports. They can filter these reports by date, project type, or status to prioritize review.
- **Blog Management**: Admins can write, edit, and publish blog posts to inform users about specific scams or scam types (e.g., phishing, investment fraud, identity theft). These blog posts are visible to the public once published.

### 5. **Blog Posts**
- **Viewing Blogs**: Website visitors can view publicly available blog posts organized by date and category.
- **Comments**: Registered users can comment on blog posts to share insights, ask questions, or discuss the topic. Admins can moderate these comments before they appear publicly.

### 6. **Media in Blog Posts**
- **Adding Media**: Admins can enrich blog posts with images, videos, and other media types. These are securely stored and reusable, helping to enhance post quality and clarity.
