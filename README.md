# Scam Sleuth

## Overview

**Scam Sleuth** is a platform that allows users to report scam projects, and for admins to review, manage, and inform the public about various scams. The website provides a secure environment for users to submit reports, while also offering valuable content in the form of blog posts to keep everyone informed about the latest scams.

## How It Works

### 1. **User Registration & Authentication**
- **Sign Up**: New users can sign up with their email, name, and password. Their password is securely hashed, and they must verify their email before their account becomes active.
- **Login**: Returning users can log in using their email and password. Once authenticated, they can access the scam report submission page.

### 2. **Submitting Scam Reports**
- **Report Form**: Once logged in, users can submit reports on scam projects. They can provide details like the project name, a description, and any evidence (e.g., links, screenshots).
- **Submission Review**: All submitted reports are sent to the admin panel for review. The reports are private and only visible to admins until further action is taken.

### 3. **Admin Dashboard**
- **Review Reports**: Admins can log in and access a comprehensive list of all user-submitted scam reports. They can filter these reports by date, project type, or status to help prioritize their review.
- **Blog Management**: Admins can write, edit, and publish blog posts to inform users about specific scams or scam types (e.g., phishing, investment fraud, identity theft). These blog posts are visible to the public once published.
  
### 4. **Blog Posts**
- **Viewing Blogs**: Website visitors can view publicly available blog posts. Blog posts are organized by date and category (e.g., phishing, financial scams). Users can read blog posts to stay informed about the latest scams.
- **Comments**: Registered users can comment on blog posts to share insights, ask questions, or discuss the content. Admins have the ability to moderate and approve comments before they are publicly visible.

### 5. **Media in Blog Posts**
- **Adding Media**: Admins can enrich blog posts with images, videos, and other media types. These media files are securely stored and can be reused across multiple posts. This helps to provide detailed evidence and make the blog content more engaging.
